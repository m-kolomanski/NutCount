# Quick-start
Currently the app in only available in Polish (target user requirement). I will add english language support in the future.

You can add new food items to your catalogue in the *Katalog* tab. You will need to specify the name, category, calories and unit. Then you will be able to select desired food item from the pick-list in the *Dzisiaj* tab, provide consumed amount and add the item to your daily intake. The app will display table with food intake for the day and show a summary of caloric intake.
