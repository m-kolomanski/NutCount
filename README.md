# Quick-start
Currently the app in only available in Polish (target user requirement). I will add english language support in the future.

You can add new food items to your catalogue in the *Katalog* tab. You will need to specify the name, category, calories and unit. Then you will be able to select desired food item from the pick-list in the *Dzisiaj* tab, provide consumed amount and add the item to your daily intake. The app will display table with food intake for the day and show a summary of caloric intake. You can also use the "Skomponuj danie" to create a dish - simply click on "Dodaj nowe danie" and add whichever ingridients you need, along with total weight and container for the dish. The app will calculate calories per 100grams, as well as calories and weight for 4-portions and 6-portions split. The dish will be added to your cookbook and will be available for easy editing later on.
